## FAQ

**Q: Will this be available for iOS/MacOS?**

A: Not for the foreseeable future. To my knowledge, there is no way to develop apps for iOS/MacOS without XCode (which requires a MacBook) and an iPhone, none of which I own - I also have no plans of acquiring one or renting a remote desktop just for iOS/MacOS development anytime soon.
